# Scenario Based Learning

## What is Scenario Based Learning

When I want to learn a new technology, I am able to find a lot of resources to learn the syntax of a particular programming language/technology.

But, I can not find resources which give me a production level problem scenario, from which I can able to learn the technology.

So, I thought, why don’t I create a one which will be helpful for developers like me to learn a programming language or technology by practicing a problem scenario.

## Why it is important

Every time, we learn something. we go and find something to implement in it to get a good grasp of it. From, a beginner perspective. it is great.

But, there is a gap between a beginners who learn the technology to a person who works in the production level application. we really don’t know what kind of a problem the particular technology solves in real industrial applications until we work for a company or in a freelancing project

What I am going to do is, I will be sharing all the problem scenarios that I faced in the production. So, the beginner for the particular technology can replicate the scenario on his own and learn from it.

Basically, he/she is going to gain my experience through learning on his own. So, In the future, if he faces the same problem scenario, he/she can tackle it in an efficient way.

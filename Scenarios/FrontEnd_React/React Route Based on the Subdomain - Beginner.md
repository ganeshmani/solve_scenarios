## Scenario

A client wants you to develop an application just like a Slack. We will take a problem scenario from that application and solve it here. When a user hits the base url like(slack.com), it should be redirected to a Base application login page. At the same time, when a user hits it with workspace subdomain (google.slack.com) it should redirect to a different login/signup page.

## Problem

Create a React App as per the above explained scenario. Get the subdomain from the url and display the name of it in login and signup page.
